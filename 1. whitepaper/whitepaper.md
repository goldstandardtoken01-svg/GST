# Gold Standard Token (GST) — Whitepaper  
*A community‑led Web3 asset built on transparency, shared ownership, and sustainable long‑term value.*

## 1. Introduction
Gold Standard Token (GST) is a community‑driven digital asset designed to align contributors, holders, and ecosystem participants through transparent governance and sustainable token economics. GST emphasizes openness, fairness, and long‑term value creation.

## 2. Vision
GST aims to establish a decentralized ecosystem where value is created collaboratively and governed openly. The project prioritizes transparency, equitable participation, and a clear framework for long‑term ecosystem growth.

## 3. Token Purpose
GST serves three primary functions:
- **Governance Access** — Participate in decision‑making and proposal voting  
- **Ecosystem Utility** — Unlock features, tools, and future integrations  
- **Alignment Mechanism** — Incentivize contributors and long‑term holders  

## 4. Token Model
GST uses a fixed‑supply, transparent distribution model:
- 60% Community & Public Allocation  
- 20% Ecosystem Growth  
- 10% Treasury  
- 10% Contributors  

There are no private sales, insider allocations, or preferential terms.

## 5. Governance
GST governance is open, token‑holder driven, and designed for clarity and accountability. Holders can:
- Submit proposals  
- Vote on ecosystem upgrades  
- Allocate treasury resources  
- Shape long‑term strategic direction  

## 6. Treasury
The treasury is governed entirely by token holders and supports:
- Development  
- Community initiatives  
- Grants  
- Liquidity and ecosystem support  

All treasury actions require transparent governance approval.

## 7. Roadmap Overview
- **Phase 1:** Launch, documentation, and initial community formation  
- **Phase 2:** Governance activation and proposal framework  
- **Phase 3:** Ecosystem tools and integrations  
- **Phase 4:** Expansion, partnerships, and contributor programs  

## 8. Conclusion
GST is built to evolve through open participation and transparent governance. This whitepaper outlines the foundation of the ecosystem, with future direction shaped collectively by its community of holders and contributors.
